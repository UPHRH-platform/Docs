# Platform Overview



1. Overall Objective and Users

The Uttar Pradesh State Medical Faculty (UPSMF) wants to set up an online platform to manage multiple functions regarding educational training, assessments, and job placement of allied healthcare professionals (AHPs) such as nurses, paramedical staff, lab technicians etc. The overall objective of the platform is to improve the quality of AHP medical education in the state, and eventually, improve the overall quality of healthcare delivery. 

Following entities will need to be onboarded onto the platform to achieve the platform’s objective:



1. AHP course students
2. Medical institutes
3. Experienced AHPs (nurses, paramedical staff etc.)
4. Hospitals or healthcare centres
5. UP SMF and other allied departments
6. Field assessors (for institute verification and assessments)

ADD following above or below:



* Abbreviations (all abbreviations we use including CASA, NIC, etc)
* Clarifications of entities - ex: Candidates can be students or professionals
1. Modules and Functionalities

Functionalities for the current roadmap of the platform have been identified, bucketed into 5 functional modules:



1. **Rating and Affiliation** for regular verification and grading of institutes and enable transparent decision-making for prospective students during the admission process
2. **Centralised Admissions** for prospective candidates looking to enrol in medical institutes for AHP courses (diploma / degree programs) to reduce the burden of institute-specific application process and remove discretion from the admissions process. 
3. **Competency based Assessments **of medical students and experienced professionals to enable tracking of role and function wise core competencies required by professionals to perform at their workplace
4. **Verifiable Resume** to enable ease of access and verification of a professional’s education and work history when applying for jobs in hospitals and health centres
5. **Aspirational Profession **module encompasses two key functionalities - (1) a job discovery and tracking platform to enable institute graduates to search for and apply for jobs, and (2) a learning management system (LMS) to enable access to online skilling courses to bridge the competency gaps identified as part of the competency based assessments

The Q1 scope includes setting up the registries & masters in the core, assessments module & LMS module.


# Platform Architecture

A layered architecture is envisioned for building the platform with a **_Core Layer _**including the registries, credentials and masters as per defined standards and specifications. Above that is the **_Transaction Layer _**with transactional event data storage, intelligence engine, and communication engine. The **_Application Layer_** includes the five functional modules (described in the previous section) and platform UI. An open API layer connects the core with the application layer.

The platform will be built leveraging open-source [Sunbird](https://www.sunbird.org/) building blocks, which form the base of Ministry of Education’s (MoE) DIKSHA platform and Department of Personnel and Training’s (DoPT) human resource management platform, iGOT. Having Sunbird form the base of the UP HRH platform, will allow it to be contributed back to Sunbird repository for use by any other government entity in the country. 

The diagram below highlights the Sunbird building blocks that will be used to build different components of the platform.

# User Registries



1. Registry Entities

All user entities will be registry compliant to ensure privacy of users’ personal information. Registries allow each user to be in control of their data and can customise which applications (including the frontend of the platform) can access their personal details. A registry-compliant construct ensures that registry specific functionalities can be activated for all modules of the platform. 

 

Sunbird RC will form the base that houses all user entity information to enable secure and privacy-enabled user management. 

Currently, a UPSMF portal - CASA, ([https://upsmfac.org/](https://upsmfac.org/)) is being used for several functionalities, additional to the modules mentioned in the previous section. The [database](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19NDRjx3mmn9MO3S70dhoNwQwCPCLIBac/view?usp=sharing) is powered by MS SQL which houses details of these entities. 

Each user on the platform will be part of a registry and will have a unique process of getting onboarded (access & authentication) to the platform. Different workflows have been defined to enable this onboarding process.

The following [approach](https://app.diagrams.net/#G12h9tK-OHANrqlMFefe2mpg0cVStRokC6) will be followed to ensure a **_single source of truth _**for entity information and **_registry compliance _**for the platform overall.

   <td>Functionalities on CASA being used in parallel to the new UP HRH platform
   </td>
   <td>- CASA to remain as the single source of truth for core entities - students, institutes and faculty
<p>
- A copy of these entities to be created as registries on Sunbird RC, with the ability to update entries as changes occur in the CASA databases
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>2
   </td>
   <td>CASA functionalities fully migrated to UP HRH platform and the old platform is sunset

# Roles

**Ideal State**: Roles are defined by the **_admin_** and each role is mapped to a series of permissions (global or module specific). Each user of the platform can be mapped to one or multiple roles and all permissions mapped to these roles will be allowed.  

Roles will have varying functions depending on the module. The following table lists the modules, suggested applicable roles and suggested authorization for these roles as part of the module.

# Competency Management



1. Understanding FRAC[^1] framework
Professional competence of each AHP student / faculty / professional will be tracked against a FRAC framework (incorporated in DOPT’s iGOT platform) which stands for functions, roles, activities and competencies. 

**_Positions_** or functions refer to the job role of an individual, e.g., for a lecturer of the nursing degree course, the function is that of a _‘nursing faculty’. _The function of a student hired to administer anaesthesia in a district hospital, the function is that of an an _‘anaesthesia nurse’_

**_Roles_** refer to bucketing, abstraction of activities that are to be performed by the individual in a particular position. E.g., a general nurse midwife (GNM) will have the following roles - _manage normal delivery, caring for normal newborn_ etc.  

**_Activities_** offer a higher level of detail and specificity over roles pertaining to a specific position. E.g., the activities for a GNM under the role ‘manage normal delivery’ can be - _describe all markers of a normal delivery, describe all steps under normal delivery, perform all steps for normal delivery_ etc. 

**Competencies **refer to the specific behavioural, domain and functional understanding / competence that the individual must possess to be able to successfully perform the activities mentioned above, Examples of competencies for a GNM include - _understands components of normal delivery and second stage of labour_, _understands complications in PW and it’s management,_ etc. Each competency will have 3 to 5 levels which indicate the level of difficulty or proficiency for that competency.

![alt_text](images/image3.png "image_tooltip")




* Each user (candidate / faculty) will get mapped to a single position i.e., _no user will be mapped to 2 or more positions_
* Each position will map to a set of roles
* A role can be mapped to one or more positions i.e., _mapping of roles to positions is not in a strict hierarchy_
* Roles are essentially logical aggregation / bucketing of activities
* An activity can map to more than 1 role - _activity to role mapping is not unique_
* An activity can map to two roles from either the same positions or two roles from different positions
* Every competency has 3 to 5 levels (L1, L2 and so on)
* Levels of a competency are progressive - _i.e., L2 is more complex / difficult than L1, if a candidate is at CXL3, they will be proficient in CXL2 and CXL1_
* Competency levels (CXLX) and not competencies (CX) map to activities
* Each activity should map to at least one competency level (CXLX)
* Every competency level should map to at least one activity
* Levels of the same competency can map to different activities (e.g., C1L1 to A1 and C1L2 to A2)
* One competency level (CXLX) can map to two or more activities (same or different role, same or different position)
3. Schemas of Competency Masters

The following table lists down the masters which will store all competency data for use in several modules of the platform.
